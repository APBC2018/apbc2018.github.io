# Visa Information

All overseas visitors wishing to enter Japan require a valid Passport. Visa will also be required for participants coming from the countries without visa exemption agreements with Japan. 
Entry into Japan for 90 days is easy to obtain a Visa. Participants requiring visas should apply well in advance to Japanese consular offices or diplomatic missions in their countries prior to making final travel arrangements with a travel agent. We will be glad to help with the arrangements for the oral presenters.

For more information about visa, please see [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html](http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html)
